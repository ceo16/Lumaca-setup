The batch script `build.bat` will download all the softwares required, set the config files and build the Lumaca Setup from `setup.nsi` sources script.

- Download and install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) (follow default setup settings).

- Open CMD Windows Terminal and run the following commands to clone recursively the Lumaca git with its submodules and run build.bat to launch the build:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Lumaca-Official/retrobat-setup.git
```
```
cd Lumaca
build.bat
```
- Once the build process is done, you will find the Lumaca Setup in the build directory.
